# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I performed multiple Linear regression on vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, AWD and vehicle_length to check if they could predict MPG..





ording to the Pr(>|t|) values in the picture above, the Intercept (p-value is 5.08), ground_clearance (p-value is 5.21) and the vehicle_length (p-value is 2.60) all provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset which means that there are variables that we haven't considered or observed.

According to the linear regression model, the p-value 5.35e-11 is less than the our assumed significant p-value of 0.05. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and the slope of our linear model is not considered to be zero.
